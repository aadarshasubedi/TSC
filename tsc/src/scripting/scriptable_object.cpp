/* The `m_callbacks' member variable of the cScriptableObject class
 * is blasphemical currently. It holds mruby objects (mrb_value instances)
 * of DIFFERENT mruby interpreters! The reason for this is sublevel
 * handling. Each level has its own mruby interpreter attached, but
 * while the sublevel is active, mruby handlers from the outer
 * main level are “suspended” and should not be run. Problem is,
 * some objects, most notably the level player (cLevel_Player singleton
 * instance), is shared amongst all currently active levels. This is
 * a design flaw that should probably be fixed, but to work around
 * the problem m_callbacks just maps an event handler by both level
 * and event name. If you tried to run an event handler from a level
 * different from the active one (pActive_Level), this would actually
 * work and have effect on the currently invisible level. However, this
 * is unintended and not allowed by the outbound interface of the
 * cScriptable_Object class hence. When a sublevel is destroyed, it
 * is required to remove all objects it has from the `m_callbacks'
 * member by employing clear_event_handlers() with its level name
 * passed. */

/**
 * Clear all event handlers for all events. This is necessary when
 * you wipe out the mruby interpreter and set up a new one, as does
 * cLevel::Reinitialize_MRuby_Interpreter(), because deleting the
 * mruby interpreter automatically invalidates any mruby object
 * reference (`mrb_value`) still flying around. If you don’t clear
 * the event handler list (which precisely holds `mrb_values`) you
 * will get unpredictable behaviour reaching from mruby exceptions
 * to segmentation faults when an event gets fired for which an
 * event handler has been registered prior to deleting the mruby
 * interpreter.
 *
 * This method may also be used to just wipe out the event handlers for
 * a specific level by passing the parameter `levelname`. This situation
 * can arise if you are dealing with sublevels, where more than one level
 * can be loaded at a time.
 *
 * \param[in] level ("") level to clear. If an empty string, all event
 * handlers for all levels a cleared. If the level you want to clear
 * the event handlers for is ~/.local/share/tsc/foo.tsclvl, then you
 * pass in `"foo"` for this parameter. A user and a game level of the
 * same name cannot be loaded at the same time, so this is not a
 * problem here.

    /**
     * Main class for managing the happenings in the game. Each state
     * the game may has is represented by a scene that encapsulates
     * all the information required for it.
     *
     * The scenes are managed by a stack, where the scene on top of
     * the stack is the active (current) scene. By placing a new scene
     * on top of the stack, the game switches to it; by removing the
     * top scene from the stack, the game returns to the previous
     * scene.
     *
     * You can retrieve two interesting values from the global instance
     * of this class via Get_FPS() and Get_Speedfactor(). The former
     * returns how many frames have elapsed during the last mainloop
     * iteration. The latter is constructed by the time the last
     * iteration of the mainloop needed divided by the FPS, which
     * results in a variable factor that:
     *
     * 1. Grows if the FPS are lower, i.e. it is larger if the game
     *    has a slower overall experience, and
     * 2. Shrinks if the FPS are higher, i.e. it is smaller if the
     *    game has a faster overall experience.
     *
     * The reasoning behind that factor is that objects moving on
     * the screen do not move super-fast with a high FPS, and super-slow
     * with a low FPS. To move over the same amount of pixels in the
     * same time you need to do smaller movement steps with a higher
     * FPS and smaller movement steps with a smaller FPS. To ease
     * this calculation, you can just multiply your desired distance
     * with the speedfactor which you can retrieve from this class,
     * and the object will behave roughly the same relative to the
     * user’s screen and time regardless of the FPS.
     *
     * The calculation breaks if a frame needs longer than a second
     * to be processed. But than you can’t play the game anyway.

     * Binary tree. This class is a simple implementation of a binary
     * tree structure, i.e. a container whose values are stored in
     * a structured way determined by their size. This allows to
     * to very fast checks as for whether a value is contained in
     * this container.
     *
     * The only values supported by this specific implementation are unsigned
     * longs. However, as each node also has an associated data reference,
     * this shouldnâ€™t hurt. Just instanciate the template with your desired
     * type for the referenced data.
     *
     * Note that deleting an instance of this class will recursively delete
     * all child nodes of that particular instance.
